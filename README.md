# Projects In Progress
### Lost
  [*Lost*](https://github.com/AdUhTkJm/Lost) is designed to be a plot game. It is based on the console input/output instead of graphical interface, to simulate a communicator better. The development of plot can be controlled through choosing the options, which are usually about difficulties the main character encounters.
  
  This game is inspired by *Lifeline*.

## About Projects
Currently, I work on projects with only myself. Also, I usually fail to think of interesting ideas to make a good game.

Welcome if you want to join or advise me.
