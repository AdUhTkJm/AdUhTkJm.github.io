## Lost
  (Haven't uploaded to github yet)
  *Lost* is a plot game. It is based on the console input/output instead of graphical interface. The development of plot can be controlled through choosing the options, which are usually difficulties the main character encounters.
  This game is inspired by *Lifeline*.
